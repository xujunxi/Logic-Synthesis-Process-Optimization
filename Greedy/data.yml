# This code is revised from DRiLLs paper baseline result
# Change environment from 7nm ASICs mapping to FPGA mapping

# ========================================================================
# This file holds parameters for running a greedy algorithm that optimizes
# a logic synthesis flow using ABC

# path of the design file in one of the accepted formats by ABC
design_file: max„ÄÅ.v

# the directory to hold the output of the iterations
output_dir: result

mapping:
  clock_period: 150   # in pico seconds
  library_file: tech.lib

# the number of iterations for the greedy optimization
iterations: 50

# add more optimization to the toolbox
optimizations:
  - rewrite
  - rewrite -z
  - refactor
  - refactor -z
  - resub
  - resub -z
  - balance

# when the greedy algorithm get stuck, it applies one of the below post-mapping commands
post_mapping_commands:
- dnsize -D 150
- upsize -D 150
- buffer
